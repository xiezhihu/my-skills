# Editability Policy

V1 decks have two explicit modes:

- `$awesome-ppt-std`: stable image-first PPTX generation.
- `$awesome-ppt-editable`: experimental image-first generation plus `ppt-master` native reconstruction.

Standard mode decks are image-model-rendered PPTX files:

- Generated raster images provide the complete visible slide, including text.
- PowerPoint assembly turns those rendered images into a deck.
- Optional native PPT text boxes are helper layers only, not the default content path.
- Full native editability is available only through a second-stage `ppt-master` reconstruction pass.

## Image By Default

Put these into generated slide images:

- Titles, subtitles, bullets, quotes, captions, source notes, and footers.
- Numeric labels, callouts, and short chart/table labels.
- Backgrounds, illustrations, scenes, textures, atmosphere, and visual metaphors.
- Complex visual compositions that are expensive to recreate as native shapes.
- Subject imagery and editorial art.

## Optional Editable Helper Layer

Use `editable_text` only when the user explicitly wants a manual-editing layer or when you need an accessibility/reconstruction aid.

Rules:

- Do not use `editable_text` to supply missing visible content after image generation.
- Do not create visible duplicate text over correctly rendered image text unless the user asks for it.
- If used, keep `editable_text` aligned with `rendered_text` so future rebuilding is possible.
- Tell the user clearly whether text is baked into images, editable as native PPT text, or both.

## PPT Master Native Reconstruction

When the user asks for a fully editable deck, use `$awesome-ppt-editable` when possible. Do not try to patch the image-first deck with duplicated overlays. Instead:

- Build and verify the image-first PPTX first.
- Export a `ppt-master` handoff from `deck.json`.
- Use `ppt-master` to rebuild each slide as native editable SVG/PowerPoint elements.
- Use generated slide images only as visual references.
- Use `rendered_text` as the exact text source; do not OCR or paraphrase from screenshots.

The final response must distinguish the two artifacts: the image-first PPTX and the `ppt-master` optimized native editable PPTX. If only the handoff was created and `ppt-master` did not export a native PPTX, say that explicitly.

## When To Pause

Pause and explain the tradeoff before proceeding if:

- The user needs legal, medical, financial, or compliance text to be perfectly editable and auditable.
- The slide needs a dense table or many exact numbers.
- The user asks for both "all text rendered by image model" and "all text natively editable" as hard requirements.
- The generated image repeatedly misspells required text after targeted retries.
- `ppt-master` is unavailable but the user explicitly requires native editability.

## Quality Gates

A deck fails v1 quality if:

- A slide lacks `rendered_text`.
- `image_prompt` does not include every `rendered_text` item verbatim.
- Generated slide images omit or misspell required visible text.
- Generated slide images contain unwanted extra text or gibberish.
- `deck.slide_count` differs from the requested `--pages`.
- A generated image has the wrong aspect ratio.
- A slide has no clear purpose.
- The output PPTX cannot be written.
- The final response implies full native text editability when the visible text is baked into images.
- The final response implies `ppt-master` produced a native editable deck if only the handoff brief was created.
