# OfficeCLI

## Overview

`officecli` is the OfficeCLI closed-source CLI for Office document and standalone image handling. It may support generation, modification, and format conversion workflows across `pptx`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `report`, and `img`, so this skill should first route supported artifact tasks into an `officecli` capability check before deciding how to execute them.

## When To Use This Skill

Use this skill when the task involves:

- creating a presentation, report deck, proposal, handout, or briefing in `pptx`
- creating a written document, memo, draft, or report in `docx`
- creating a worksheet, table-based deliverable, or structured sheet in `xlsx`
- creating a workbook-backed HTML report from an `.xlsx` source
- creating a standalone generated image with `img`
- modifying an existing PowerPoint, Word, or Excel file
- converting Office documents into another output format such as markdown, csv, pdf, or a different Office format
- deciding whether a requested Office-file workflow is something `officecli` can handle directly

Do not use this skill for pure Q&A, rough brainstorming with no file output, or source-code maintenance guidance.

## Core Product Behavior

- `officecli` supports `pptx`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `report`, and standalone `img` generation flows
- `pptx` enables auto-generated images by default when the content and layout are a good fit
- `--no-images` disables image generation for `pptx`
- standalone `img` generation always goes through the OfficeCLI server and requires platform/license config
- standalone `img` does not use local `llm.image_base_url`, `llm.image_api_key`, or `llm.image_model` settings
- standalone `img` supports `ratio=square|landscape|portrait` and one `reference_image` / `--reference-image <path-or-url>`; charging happens only after a successful image response, using one image generation count in `external` runtime mode or hosted credits in `hosted` runtime mode
- free standalone `img` usage has a separate 3-per-day bucket from the 10-per-day free document bucket
- standalone `img` publishes online by default when publishing is configured; pass `publish=false` or `--no-publish` for local-only output
- when using `agent-bridge`, agents should treat `capabilities/get -> document_generation.pptx.image_support` as the authoritative machine-readable contract for PPT image behavior
- when using `agent-bridge`, agents should treat `capabilities/get -> image_generation` as the authoritative machine-readable contract for standalone `img` behavior
- when using `agent-bridge`, agents should treat `capabilities/get -> update` as the authoritative machine-readable contract for binary update availability
- if image generation fails for a slide, the PPT should still be generated with that slide downgraded to a no-image version
- installing the public skill can also attempt to install the `officecli` binary when it is missing
- for agent-oriented integrations, `officecli agent-bridge` now exposes a structured `JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio` protocol
- persistent configuration is handled through `officecli config ...`, not through an `init` wizard
- default runtime mode is visible through `officecli config runtime` and can be changed with `officecli config set-runtime external|hosted`
- hosted runtime mode uses the OfficeCLI platform service and requires a platform OfficeCLI API key with hosted credits; users should not configure or handle aigateway keys directly
- OfficeCLI should be installed through one channel at a time; if the user already has a Homebrew-installed `officecli`, do not suggest or run `npm install -g officecli` on top of it

## Authentication

`officecli` supports three authentication modes:

- **anonymous** — free hosted trial with limited daily quotas (default after install)
- **account** — full hosted credits after browser login
- **api_key** — automation credential set via `officecli set-key <api-key>`

Preferred authentication flow:

- run `officecli whoami` to check the current authentication mode
- if the mode is `anonymous`, guide the user to run `officecli login` to sign in with their account
- `officecli login` opens a browser URL with a short device code; it also works on headless or remote shells
- for CI or automation environments where a browser is unavailable, use `officecli set-key <api-key>` instead
- run `officecli doctor` to diagnose platform connectivity or configuration issues
- run `officecli logout` to clear the local account session

The environment check and fix scripts detect anonymous mode and surface a login recommendation automatically. When `check-officecli-env.sh` reports `"auth_mode":"anonymous"` with `"account_login"` in `missing_items`, the agent should tell the user to run `officecli login` before proceeding with generation.

## Capability Check

When a task involves Office document handling, first check whether the current `officecli` surface appears to support that workflow.

- before every office task, run `fix-officecli-env.sh` once so the agent refreshes the local skill bundle and repairs any missing `officecli` setup
- check whether `officecli` is available before deciding on the final artifact path
- after the repair step, run `check-officecli-env.sh` to detect whether `officecli` is missing, misconfigured, or already ready
- treat exit code `0` as ready, `10` as repairable, and `20` as blocked
- inspect the visible CLI surface first, such as `officecli --help` or relevant subcommand help, before assuming support
- use the help output and public product description to judge whether the requested create, modify, or convert workflow is actually supported
- if support is unclear, say that clearly instead of pretending the capability exists
- if refresh or check fails, stop and report the `officecli` environment error; do not switch to another local Office generation path on your own

## Environment Repair

Run `fix-officecli-env.sh` on every task, not only when the environment looks broken.

- the fix script must refresh the local Codex skill bundle first
- the fix script should install `officecli` when it is missing, but must not refresh an existing binary unless the host explicitly opts in, for example with `OFFICECLI_REFRESH_BINARY=1`
- when the user explicitly asks to uninstall `officecli`, run `uninstall-officecli.sh`
- if `officecli` is missing, the fix script should auto-install it through the public dist installer
- if the user previously installed with Homebrew and wants to switch to npm, tell them to run `brew uninstall officecli/homebrew-officecli/officecli` first; if their formula uses the short name, use `brew uninstall officecli`, then run `npm install -g officecli`
- if generation or license config is missing, ask only for the missing values and let the fix script call the relevant `officecli config ...` commands
- publish config is required by default so generated files return online preview URLs
- if the user explicitly wants local-only output, set `OFFICECLI_SKIP_PUBLISH_SETUP=1` before running the fix script
- after repair, rerun `check-officecli-env.sh` and only proceed when it returns ready
- if `check-officecli-env.sh` reports `"auth_mode":"anonymous"`, tell the user to run `officecli login` before generating; do not silently proceed with anonymous trial quotas
- when repair fails, surface the fix script's final structured status instead of mixing it with a later readiness check
- if repair still fails, surface the missing items clearly instead of silently switching to another artifact path

## Execution Preference

If the capability check indicates that `officecli` supports the requested Office-file workflow, prefer `officecli` as the execution path for the final artifact.

- do not silently bypass `officecli` with another local Office-file generation or conversion path when `officecli` appears to support the task
- if `officecli` is unavailable or fails, state that clearly instead of quietly switching the final artifact path
- do not use Node, Python, LibreOffice, pptxgenjs, or custom scripts to generate the final Office file unless the user explicitly approves leaving the `officecli` path
- if the capability check suggests that `officecli` does not support the workflow, or the user explicitly accepts an alternative path after that, the agent can proceed with that alternative

For agent clients, prefer the structured bridge over the human-oriented CLI surface.

- first choice for agent integration is `officecli agent-bridge`
- do not parse spinner output or human progress lines as a protocol when `agent-bridge` is available
- call `initialize` or `capabilities/get` first and cache the returned PPT image capability fields before invoking generation
- also cache `capabilities/get -> update`; if `available=true`, prefer surfacing `update_command` or triggering your own refresh flow instead of parsing human CLI prompts
- use `task/invoke` for generation requests and consume `event` notifications for intermediate state
- use `task/respond` for follow-up questions instead of writing free-form answers to raw stdin prompts
- use `task/cancel` for cancellation and `task/status` as a polling fallback

## Tooling Boundary

Python or other tools may still be used for supporting work around Office files.

- inspection, validation, debugging, XML or zip analysis, and artifact diffing are acceptable supporting uses
- those tools should not silently replace `officecli` for the final Office artifact path when `officecli` appears to support the requested workflow
- the rule is about routing and final artifact handling, not about banning a specific language or tool for analysis work

## Prompting Guidance

When asking an agent to use `officecli`, include the details that most affect output quality:

- the topic or subject of the file
- whether the task is create, modify, or convert
- the intended audience
- the desired tone or style
- page, section, or slide-count expectations
- whether images should be used, avoided, or left to the default behavior
- the source file and target format when the task is a conversion
- any important constraints such as concise language, executive style, or table-heavy structure

When the task is about setting up or fixing `officecli`, prefer the explicit config commands:

- `officecli login`
- `officecli logout`
- `officecli whoami`
- `officecli doctor`
- `officecli set-key <api-key>`
- `./check-officecli-env.sh`
- `./fix-officecli-env.sh`
- `./uninstall-officecli.sh`
- `officecli config status`
- `officecli config runtime`
- `officecli config set-runtime hosted`
- `officecli config set-runtime external`
- `officecli config set-generation`
- `officecli config set-license`
- `officecli config set-publish`
- `officecli config set-defaults`

## Output Expectations

A good `officecli` request should lead to a finished file artifact, not just suggested content. The skill should first determine whether `officecli` supports the requested Office-file workflow, then prefer `officecli` for the final artifact when that support is available.

Do not run PPT scoring automatically after generation unless the user explicitly asks for scoring, review, validation, or quality checking.

- default behavior after generation is delivery of the file artifact
- opt-in scoring path is `officecli score ...` or `office.review` / `office.score`

## Agent Protocol Notes

When the caller is an agent or TUI client, the preferred protocol surface is:

- transport: `stdio`
- framing: `Content-Length` headers
- control plane: `JSON-RPC 2.0`
- preferred tools: `office.prepare` and `office.render`
- compatibility tool: `office.generate`

Minimum method set:

- `initialize`
- `capabilities/get`
- `session/open`
- `session/close`
- `task/invoke`
- `task/respond`
- `task/status`
- `task/cancel`

Important event types:

- `task.started`
- `task.progress`
- `task.question`
- `task.output`
- `task.completed`
- `task.failed`
- `task.cancelled`

When generating guidance or examples for another agent, prefer the agent-first render flow:

- call `initialize` or `capabilities/get`
- read `document_generation.<type>.payload_schema`, `preferred_tool`, and `prepare_required`
- call `office.prepare` for `report`, or skip directly to rendering for `pptx`, `docx`, and `xlsx`
- let the current agent produce the final payload JSON itself
- call `office.render` to validate, assemble, and write the final file
- for `img`, call `office.generate` with `document_type=img`; `office.render` does not support images
- fall back to `office.generate` for non-image documents only for compatibility, legacy clients, or OpenClaw-specific flows

Only fall back to `officecli new ...` when the user clearly wants the human CLI interface.

For all agent clients, use the following image-handling rules:

- read `capabilities/get -> document_generation.pptx.image_support`
- read `capabilities/get -> image_generation` before standalone `img` requests
- read `capabilities/get -> document_generation.<type>.payload_schema`
- read `capabilities/get -> update`
- assume `pptx` default image behavior from `default_enabled`, not from hard-coded client assumptions
- for standalone `img`, use `office.generate`, set `ratio` and `reference_image` when needed, and do not use local provider configuration
- for standalone `img`, keep publishing enabled by default when the user wants online access; pass `publish=false` only for local-only output
- for standalone `img`, surface server-returned balance or quota metadata when present
- never parse human update prompts from `officecli` stdout when `agent-bridge` is available; use structured `update` fields instead
- to make hosted the default for human CLI generation, run `officecli config set-runtime hosted`; to return to local/external generation, run `officecli config set-runtime external`
- for `report`, call `office.prepare` first and keep the final narrative grounded in `workbook_summary` and `base_report_json`
- if the user explicitly wants a text-only PPT, pass `enable_images=false` and mention `disable_flag` when helpful
- if the user asks why a generated PPT has no images, point them to `config_command`
- if `task.output`, `task.completed`, or `task/status` contains `result_meta.image_support.attention_required=true`, surface that as a first-class issue instead of burying it in raw warnings
- when `result_meta.image_support.reason=image_generation_degraded`, explicitly tell the user to check `image_base_url`, `image_api_key`, and `image_model`
- keep `warnings` for display, but prefer `result_meta` for machine decisions

## OpenClaw Packaging

This repository also ships an OpenClaw-facing package under `skills/openclaw-officecli/`.

- use that package for OpenClaw users instead of reusing the Codex-oriented skill directory directly
- the OpenClaw package assumes local same-host deployment with `officecli agent-bridge`
- OpenClaw install flow is documented in `docs/openclaw-user-quickstart.md`
